INSTRUCTIONS:
When you open up the program, specify if you want to find the perceived change in frequency with:
1.The source of the sound moving towards the observer 
2.The source of the sound moving away from the observer
3.The observer moving towards the source of the sound
4.The observer moving away from the source of the sound
5.The source of the sound and the observer moving towards each other
6.The source of the sound and the observer both moving apart from one another.

YOU MUST BE ABLE TO:
1.Input the speed of the source (annotated Vsc)
2.Input the speed of the sound coming from the source (annotated Vsd)
3.Input ***EITHER*** 
	A)The initial frequency of the sound (annotated as either "fe" or "f") OR
	B)The perceived (or new) frequency of the sound due to the Doppler Effect (annotated as "fh" or "f'")
******IN ORDER FOR THE PROGRAM TO WORK***********
	THIS IS HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- YOU MUST INPUT WHICHEVER FREQUENCY YOU WANT TO FIND (fe/f or fh/f') as 0! 


Hope you like the program!

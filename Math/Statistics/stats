Disp "Simple random sampling. Simple random sampling refers to a method in which all possible samples of n objects are equally likely to occur.
Disp" Example: assign a number 1-100 to all members of a population of size 100. One number is selected at a time from a list of random digits or using a random number generator. The first 10 selected without repeats are the sample.
Pause  
Disp "Stratified sampling. With stratified sampling, the population is divided into groups, based on some characteristic. Then, within each group, a SRS is taken. In stratified sampling, the groups are called strata.
Disp "Example: For a national survey we divide the population into groups or strata, based on geography - north, east, south, and west. Then, within each stratum, we might randomly select survey respondents.
Pause  
Disp "Cluster sampling. With cluster sampling, every member of the population is assigned to one, and only one, group. Each group is called a cluster. A sample of clusters is chosen using a SRS. Only individuals within sampled clusters are surveyed.
Disp "Example: Randomly choose high schools in the country and only survey people in those schools.
Disp "Difference between cluster sampling and stratified sampling. With stratified sampling, the sample includes subjects from each stratum. With cluster sampling the sample includes subjects only from sampled clusters.
Pause  
Disp "Multistage sampling. With multistage sampling, we select a sample by using combinations of different sampling methods.
Disp "Example: Stage 1, use cluster sampling to choose clusters from a population. Then, in Stage 2, we use simple random sampling to select a subset of subjects from each chosen cluster for the final sample.
Pause  
Disp "Systematic random sampling. With systematic random sampling, we create a list of every member of the population. From the
list, we randomly select the first sample element from the first k subjects on the population list. Thereafter, we select
every kth subject on the list.
Example: Select every 5th person on a list of the population.

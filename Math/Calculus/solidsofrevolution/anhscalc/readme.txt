ANHSCALC was written for use on the calculator sections of the AP Calculus AB exam. It contains 6 sections, Derivatives, Integrations, a Derivative solving program, Volume, a Quadratic solving program, and Trigonometric Identities. As the test allows calculator ram to stay uncleared, this program satisfies the necessity of having a well programmed calculator.

How do you put this on your calculator and run it? If you have an 83+ you should transfer all 7 files located in the ti83+ folder to your calculator (ANHSCALC.8XP and ZCALC1-6), if you have an 83, transfer all files from the 83 folder. Note that some originally lowercase characters were converted to uppercase when I converted the 83+ files to 83. To run the program is easy, simply run ANHSCALC.

Because ANHSCALC displays nearly all of its text on the graph, it saves the graphs, Y1, Y2, and Y3 in strings 8,9,0, and restores them when the program is properly exited. This not only gives back your graphs, but also cuts down on unwanted graphs being displayed when the program is running. If ANHSCALC is closed without pressing CLEAR, the axes, graphs, and window will probably be messed up. To fix the axes and reset the window to standard quickly, simply restart the program and close it. Your graphs however will be lost if you do this... if you had a long equation stored in one of those variables, you may want to retrieve it from the string manually; type: "String>Equ(Str#,Y#" (use catalog) and press enter.

I incorporated 2 programs into ANHSCALC that I did not write (I did not change the code, save replacing the ending with "return"), I now give the authors credit. "Derive", which takes a derivative using strings is by Brian Hare (brianhare@mail.com). "TrigID" is by Ben Ilegbodu (benmvp@stanford.edu).

Can you edit this program and distribute it? Yes, you can add content, fix errors, and distribute the program as long as you give me, and the two programmers whose programs are included within this one credit for what they have programmed. Also, this program may not be sold.

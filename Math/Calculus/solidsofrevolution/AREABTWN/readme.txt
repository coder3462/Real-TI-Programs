Area in Between Curves for the TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition

AREABTWN:  Area Between Curves

This calculates the area between two curves, Y1 and Y2.  This program works best if you can set the graph screen to where the curves intersect at only two points.  The program first searches for two intersections, one from the left side of the graph screen (Xmin) and one from the right (Xmax).  After the area is calculated, both curves are graphed and the area between curves are shaded.  Function and Radian modes are used.

The program will ask if you want to keep Y1 and Y2 that is already stored, or replace the functions.  If you choose to replace the functions, you will need to enter the functions in quotes.

Before running AREABTWN, it is recommended that you set up the window so that the functions intersect each other exactly twice.  


Examples:

The Standard Window is used.  Xmin = -10, Xmax = 10, Ymin = -10, Ymax = 10

Y1 = -2X^2 + 4X + 1, Y2 = X^2.   Area = 2.734721…

Y1 = 1.2X + .63, Y2 = -X^2 + 5X + 1.   Area = 10.58676675…

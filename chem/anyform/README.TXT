========    INSTALLATION    ========

Use TI Connect or TiLP to download FORM.8xp to your calculator.

Before using, make sure your calculator has lowercase enabled. To enable
lowercase, go into the options of any popular shell (such as MirageOS or
DoorsCS) and select whatever option says something like Enable Lowercase, or
use a lowercase-enabling program from
http://www.ticalc.org/pub/83plus/asm/programs/ to do the job.

Lowercase is required for two-letter elemental symbols because the program is
case sensitive to distinguish between formulas like "Co" (cobalt) and "CO"
(cupric oxide). Once lowercase is enabled, press ALPHA twice to go into
lowercase mode.
